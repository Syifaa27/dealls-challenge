# Root Cause Analysis - Request Session Button Bug

## Summary
An intermittent issue causes the "Request Session" button on the mentor detail page to become non-functional after login.

## Investigation Steps
- Reviewed network requests and browser console logs
- Reproduced issue on staging using different accounts
- Used Cypress test to simulate rapid navigation and login
- Checked React component lifecycle and mounting behavior

## Observations
- The button is rendered but has no event listener attached
- The React component is sometimes mounted before user session state is fully loaded
- No API call is made when the button is clicked

## Potential Root Causes
- Event listener binding skipped due to race condition in component rendering
- React state (user session) not available at time of render
- Conditional rendering fails silently if user object is undefined
- Issue triggered by stale cache or login delay
- Unhandled promise rejection prevents event binding

## Reproduction Strategy
- Add artificial delay to login/session initialization
- Use Cypress test to repeatedly login and request session
- Monitor component mounting and hook execution

## Recommendations
- Add explicit checks and fallback UI if session state is undefined
- Ensure event listeners are registered regardless of timing
- Implement logging for user state at component mount
- Add retry mechanism or loading guard before rendering interactive buttons
